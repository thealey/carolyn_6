I used impress.js to make a little web presentation for my daughter's school celebration. I don't really have time to do anything too elaborate.. mostly just put some images in and modified the demo. Impress.js is pretty great. I am not sure if I should have forked it instead of changing the origin, in any case this is not going to be of value to anyone, just so I dont lose the codes.
